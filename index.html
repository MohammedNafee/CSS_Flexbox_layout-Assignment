                    Sometimes I feel that the underlying reason behind my constant attempts to rise again after every stumble and misfortune is unknown to me. 
                    It might be the dreams, aspirations, and hopes hidden in my chest that drive me in ways I don’t fully understand towards persistence and perseverance. 
                    I believe I’m a dreamer, and my dreams fill my world. 
                    As Mohammed grows older and with the many challenges I’ve faced, there had to be a stronger and deeper motivation to continue. 
                    That motivation has been faith and the profound essence it carries.
                    My nature does not accept despair or defeat and always strives toward hope and light.
